# Echo Server
Push server for the WalletConnect v2 Protocol

> **Note** This is only available for WalletConnect v2 and is a breaking change from the Push supported in v1.

## Notification Providers
This list contains both supported and potentially planned providers
- [x] FCM (API Key)
- [ ] FCM (Google Services)
- [x] APNS (Certificate Based)
- [x] APNS (Token Based)
- [ ] Web Push

## Supporting Notifications
> **Note** Full documentation will be available soon. This is only a brief overview.

There are 3 options for receiving notifications within your wallet:
1. **Use the hosted platform.**
   Go to settings in the [cloud app](https://cloud.walletconnect.com) for a project and create a Push URL, see the documentation on Push
   prerequisites for more info.
2. Host this rust implementation.
   there is an included [`terraform`](https://github.com/WalletConnect/echo-server/tree/main/terraform) configuration to help with this.
3. Write your own implementation that follows the [spec](https://docs.walletconnect.com/2.0/specs/servers/echo/echo-server-api)

When using the hosted platform or self-hosting this implementation you have to provide the instance
you FCM API Key or APNS certificates and then - following the FCM/APNS docs - add support for that within your
wallet.

You also have to register the device with the instance of Echo Server once when the client_id is initially
generated. By sending a POST request to `<INSTANCE_URL>/clients` as per the [spec](./spec/spec.md).

## Multi-tenancy
Echo Server supports multi-tenancy. To enable multi-tenancy you need to specify a `TENANT_DATABASE_URL` which will then disable 
the single-tenant endpoints in favour of endpoints with a `/:tenant_id` prefix e.g. `/:tenant_id/client/:id`

> **Warning**
> The `TENANT_DATABASE_URL` **must** point to a different database than the `DATABASE_URL`

## Running locally

```
# Run a postgres db for functional tests
# This will be removed in future revisions
# such that you can run functional tests without
# any prerequisites
docker run -p 5432:5432 --name some-postgres2 -e POSTGRES_HOST_AUTH_METHOD=trust -d postgres
cargo test
```

## Running tests locally

```
yarn install
yarn integration:dev # or yarn integration:staging
```

## Deploying infrastructure

```
terraform -chdir=terraform init
terraform -chdir=terraform workspace select dev/staging/prod
terraform -chdir=terraform apply  -var-file="vars/$(terraform -chdir=terraform workspace show).tfvars"
```

## Using Images
There are two Dockerfiles, one `Dockerfile` is used in production by the hosted platform at WalletConnect
while `slim.Dockerfile` is a stripped down version with no features enabled i.e. Single Tenant

## Analytics & Metrics
Echo Server is instrumented with analytics & metrics to help with debugging and monitoring.
